 NT installation :
 ----------------- 
  Being on Windows, get a NT "command prompt"
 by double clicking in :
    "Program manager/Main/Command prompt"
  Then type :
     NT> mkdir <...>\OPACS
     NT> cd    <...>\OPACS
     NT> ftp ftp.lal.in2p3.fr
     anonymous
     user name

  Use the interactive WinZip facility
 to decompress and extract the files. WinZip can be
 launched by double clicking on the taZ file
 from the "File manager". The first double click
 on the taZ file will produce a tar file. A second
 double clicking on the tar file will extract the files. 
    (NT> delete WoXm.tar)
    (NT> delete WoXm.taZ)
     NT> cd OPACS/v3
     NT> edit setup.bat         # To change the "root" directory variable.

     Co\v3\mgr\Config.nmk
   ( W3o\v3\mgr\Config.nmk   )  
   ( HTMLo\v3\mgr\Config.nmk )
 If the existing "configs" do not match your environment, 
 edit these files. Existing configs are :
     NT
     NTD     (to compile in debug mode)

 If the existing "configs" do not match your environment, 
 edit these files. Existing configs are :
     ALPHA

  See the below "General considerations" for more.

 General considerations :
 ----------------------
  If using any other none "o" packages like CERN libraries, 
 or LAL Ci, that are not in a "standard" place, edit the 
 "setup" files to set the "root" directory variables that 
 say where these packages are located. 

  Some packages could be declared to Wo (like Xaw, tcl,...).
 This is done in the Wo/v3/mgr/Make.odb file. The "has"
 property of the "Make" object controls the "known" packages.
 Change this property according to examples. Run the "omake"
 tool that will regenerate the new Wo "This.mk" makefile :
     UNIX> cd <...>/Wo/v3/mgr
    (NT>   cd <...>\Wo\v3\mgr)
    (VMS$  set def disk:[<...>.Wo.v3.mgr])
     UNIX> vi Make.odb
    (NT>   edit Make.odb)
    (VMS$  edit Make.odb)
     UNIX> omake -make
    (NT>   omake -make)
    (VMS$  omake -make)
 or :
     UNIX> omake -all
    (NT>   omake -all)
    (VMS$  omake -all)
 to generate also This.nmk and This.mms for NT and VMS.
 The alias "omake" is defined in the "setup" files.
  Note that a "Make.odb" exists for each "o" package. For
 example, in the same way that above, you can reconstruct
 the Xo widgets on the Xaw library instead of MOTIF.

   OPACS/v3 contains the global Makefile, NMake and descrip.mms. 
 By default the Wo widget manager is reconstructed over MOTIF. 
 The global Makefile (NMake, descrip.mms) triggers the stand 
 alone makefiles of implied "o" packages. 
  A local Makefile (NMake, descrip.mms) includes the 
 Config.mk (.nmk, .mms) located in Co/v3/mgr (exceptions 
 are for W3o and HTMLo that are stand alone packages). 
 According to the "config" and the local macros the 
 "This.mk" (.nmk, .mms) is executed.

  In case of trouble, look the environment variables 
 in the setup files, the "configs" in the Config.mk (.nmk, .mms) 
 files and the local makefiles for other "make" macros.
